## Introduction

what data set are you working with?



what variables are you most interested in? How many observations are in your data set?



what is your question of interest?



where did you get the data from? (If possible, give a link to the data source).

github

what other pieces of context are important to explain to the reader?



## Primary Visualizations

choose an appropriate visualization, eliminate clutter, and focus attention as appropriate to answer your question of interest.

provide a written interpretation of each visualization you have, explaining what a reader should “take away” from each visualization.

## Conclusion and Wrap-Up

are there any flaws with your approach to analyzing the data you’ve selected?

are there future directions you would go if you had additional data or more time?

## Connection to Class Ideas

At the end of your write-up, you should connect your visualization(s) to ideas from class. In what ways would you argue your visualization(s) are effective ways of communicating information?
