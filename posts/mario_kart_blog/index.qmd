## Introduction

what data set are you working with?

what variables are you most interested in?

How many observations are in your data set? - 2334 overall

what is your question of interest?

Which track is the fastest?

How did the world records develop over time?
*Which track is the fastest?* 
For which track did the world record improve the most?
For how many tracks have shortcuts been discovered?
When were shortcuts discovered?
On which track does the shortcut save the most time?
Which is the longest standing world record?
Who is the player with the most world records?
Who are recent players?


where did you get the data from?
(If possible, give a link to the data source).

github

what other pieces of context are important to explain to the reader?



```{r CHUNK 2, echo = F, message = F, warning = F}
record_sum_nshortcut <- records |>
  filter(shortcut == "No", type == "Single Lap") |>
  group_by(track) |>
  summarise(avg_time = mean(time), n = n()) |>
  arrange(avg_time, desc = T) |>
  mutate(se = avg_time / n, 
         lb_se = avg_time - se,
         ub_se = avg_time + se)

record_sum_shortcut <- records |>
  filter(shortcut == "Yes", type == "Single Lap") |>
  group_by(track) |>
  summarise(avg_time = mean(time), n = n()) |>
  arrange(avg_time, desc = T)
```

## Primary Visualizations

choose an appropriate visualization, eliminate clutter, and focus attention as appropriate to answer your question of interest.

provide a written interpretation of each visualization you have, explaining what a reader should “take away” from each visualization.

```{r CHUNK 3, echo = F}
record_sum_nshortcut |>
  mutate(track = fct_reorder(track, avg_time)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = track, y = avg_time)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = track, yend = 0), color = "grey65", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size=3.5, color="red", fill=alpha("orange"), shape=21, stroke=1.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Average Time (s)") +
  xlab("Track") +
  labs(title = "Average Time to Complete One Lap (No Shortcuts)",
  caption = "Data Source: Mario Kart World Records")
```

```{r CHUNK 4, echo = F, eval = F}
record_sum_shortcut |>
  mutate(track = fct_reorder(track, avg_time)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = track, y = avg_time)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = track, yend = 0), color = "grey65", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size=3.5, color="red", fill=alpha("orange"), shape=21, stroke=1.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Average Time (s)") +
  xlab("Track") +
  labs(title = "Average Time to Complete One Lap (With Shortcuts)",
  caption = "Data Source: Mario Kart World Records")
```



```{r CHUNK 5, echo = F, warning = F, message = F}
record_short <- records |>
  group_by(shortcut, track) |>
  summarise(mean = mean(time)) |>
  pivot_wider(names_from = shortcut, values_from = mean) |>
  mutate(shortcut_save = No - Yes) |>
  filter(shortcut_save != "NA") |>
  mutate(shortcut_save = as.numeric(shortcut_save)) 


ggplot(record_short, aes(x = reorder(track, shortcut_save), y = shortcut_save)) +
  geom_segment(aes(xend = track, yend = 0), color = "grey65", size = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size=3.5, color="seagreen", fill=alpha("darkseagreen"), shape=21, stroke=1.5) +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_minimal() +
  ylab("Time (s)") +
  xlab("Track") +
  labs(title = "Average Time Saved Using Shortcuts",
  caption = "Data Source: Mario Kart World Records")
```





## Conclusion and Wrap-Up

are there any flaws with your approach to analyzing the data you’ve selected?

are there future directions you would go if you had additional data or more time?

## Connection to Class Ideas

At the end of your write-up, you should connect your visualization(s) to ideas from class.
In what ways would you argue your visualization(s) are effective ways of communicating information?
