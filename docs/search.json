    "text": "Have you ever played the classic Mario Kart game and wondered to yourself during a race, “Should I risk the shortcut?” Well, if you have, I’ve got some answers for you! And you don’t have to only take my word for it- we will be looking at results from the top players in the world, earning records in Mario Kart 64 since 1997.\nFrom personal experience, if you are not an expert Mario Kart player, taking the shortcut can lead to some disadvantages in the heat of a race. If you fall off the track while turning for the shortcut, precious time can be lost while you are dragged back on the the original track. If you hit an object trying to turn on the shortcut, you might have to back up and turn back around, which can also put you behind in a race. For these reasons, it would be beneficial to look at which tracks I should really master the shortcut, and which tracks it would be better to just stay in my lane."

    "text": "A Look at the Data\nThe data included in this analysis comes from Mario Kart World Records and contains records from players using the Nintendo 64 video game console. The variables that can be found in this data set are listed below.\n\ntrack: Track name\ntype: Single or three lap record\nshortcut: Shortcut or non-shortcut record\nplayer: Player’s name\nsystem_played: Used system (NTSC or PAL)\ndata: World record date\ntime_period: Time (hours/min/s)\ntime: Time in seconds\nrecord_duration: Record duration in days\n\nWe are primarily interested in investigating the length of time it takes to complete tracks with and without their shortcuts, therefore we will be focusing on the track, shortcut, and time variables included above. This data set originally contains 2,334 observations from various players. However, we will not be using all of these cases. Out of the 16 tracks included in this original data, four of the tracks do not include shortcuts (For those who know Mario Kart tracks, these include Bowser’s Castle, Banshee Boardwalk, Koopa Troopa Beach, and Moo Moo Farm). Since we are interested in which tracks will save us the most time by taking that shortcut, we will exclude these tracks from our analysis. We will also only be considering the recorded times of three laps races (the typical amount of laps in a tournament race) instead of a single lap to simplify our discussion."

    "text": "Visual Analysis\nTo help understand the general time it takes to race around each track, we will take a look at how long it takes players to complete three laps without using any shortcuts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph above demonstrates the average time in seconds it takes to complete three laps around each track without using the shortcut. From this we can tell that Rainbow Road appears to be the longest race, taking around 358 seconds, or 6 minutes and 15 seconds, to complete, followed by Wario Stadium at around 256 seconds, or 4 minutes and 16 seconds. The track with the fastest time is Mario Raceway, with a shorter time of 89 seconds on average (1 minute and 29 seconds). Yoshi Valley follows this track with an average time of 105 seconds, or 1 minute and 45 seconds. It is important to note that standard error for each time above was very small, and therefore was excluded from the plot.\nNow we can begin to examine how much time we can actually save by taking a shortcut. The figure below uses values taken from the difference in seconds between racing without the shortcut and racing with the shortcut. These time differences have been plotted for each track.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt appears that the amount of time saved by taking a shortcut is the most while racing in Wario Stadium, saving on average around 243 seconds of time during the entire race. On Rainbow Road, around 142 seconds have been saved from taking the shortcut. From this, it sounds like taking the shortcut on these tracks would be worth all the risk. On the other hand, taking the shortcut on the Kalimari Desert track appears to only save around 2 seconds of time, so it may be wiser to ignore this shortcut and stay on the main track."

    "text": "Conclusion\nOverall, its obvious which shortcuts have saved the best players the most time over the years, but it is important to note some flaws in this analytical approach. The charts in the previous section take the average time over all records achieved from 1997 to 2021, therefore average time shown may not be clearly representative of the exact time it takes for one individual to complete a race. Regardless of this fact, we can still learn which track shortcuts have saved the pros the most time over the years.\nIn the future, it would be interesting to dive into a bit of history surrounding Mario Kart 64, and look into when these shortcuts were each discovered. With the data used in this investigation, it would also be interesting to look at specific players who remained undefeated for the longest amount of time. Another research avenue I would be interested in exploring is within other versions of the game, such as the popular Mario Kart 8 Deluxe played on the Nintendo Switch.\nIn conclusion, whether you are practicing to set the new world record, or just practicing to beat your friends, I would advise to spend some time practicing the shortcuts in Wario Stadium and Rainbow Road, and less time in the Kalimari Desert.\nGood Luck!"

    "text": "A scence from the movie Twister (1996)\nTornadoes are a natural weather phenomenon that have intrigued storm chasers and weather gurus for years. If you’re thinking about moving to the Midwest part of the United States any time soon, they are a good factor to consider. Tornadoes can be devastating, usually taking down every structure in its path. We will be investigating tornado trends over the past 70 years, looking at when and where the most tornadoes have touched the ground over the time."

    "text": "Visual Analysis\nTo begin, we will look at the number of tornadoes reported each year since 1950.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot above we can see that throughout the late 1900’s, the number of tornadoes per year varies, but overall tends to slowly increase. The red dot represents the year with the most tornadoes recorded by the NOAA. This year is 2004, with a record number of 1,817 tornadoes. To get a closer look of what was happening in 2004, we will investigate where in the US tornadoes were touching down during this time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map demonstrates the number of tornadoes recorded in each state in 2004. From this we can see that the Midwest experienced the bulk of the tornadoes seen that year, with Texas at the top. In 2004, Texas saw 178 tornadoes throughout the year. This is not a surprise, as Texas is known for experiencing the highest number of tornadoes per year among the states in Tornado Alley. To delve even deeper into the specifics of 2004, we can analyze the number of tornadoes occurring each month in Texas.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot we can clearly examine the trend of tornadoes seen in Texas throughout the months during 2004. There are two peaks that can be seen here, one occurring in April and the other occurring in November. On April 4th, 2004 Texas recorded 23 tornadoes on this day alone. On November 23rd, 2004 there were 34 tornadoes recorded on this day."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIn conclusion, we found that the trend of tornadoes per year has been slowing increasing in the United States since the 1950’s. We have also seen that there was a spike in the number of tornadoes in 2004, with Texas receiving the majority. It would be good to acknowledge that this does not directly indicate that Texas is the most dangerous location to live when it comes to tornadoes. Texas is one of the largest states in the US, and therefore geographically covers a lot of area within Tornado Alley. It would be interesting for future analyses to investigate this topic while disregarding state boundaries.\nIn the future, it would also be interesting to include the magnitude of these tornadoes, and look into the locations that have experienced the strongest tornadoes. The width of a tornado would also be interesting to examine, as tornadoes can expand up to 2 miles in width."

I chose a continuous color scale for the map that could accurately represent the number of tornadoes in each state and chose a color palette that could be interpreted by everyone. I also increased the font size of the labels on both of the line plots so that they were easier to read."
